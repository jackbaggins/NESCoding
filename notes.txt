Segments required:

HEADER - required for emulators, defines the "cart" - as in how many and what size chips would be on a physical board (CHR ROM and PRG ROM)

ZEROPAGE - from 0 - FF the most significant byte is not needed

STARTUP - Where code starts (not in CPU, but for assembler)

VECTORS - special addresses that 6502 needs to operate
    Three interrupts
    NMI - time when scan gun in CRT reaches bottom and is going back to top of screen
    Reset - What to do if reset button is pressed
    "undefined" - interrupt for special hardware like a mapper

CHARS - Where to pull chr (graphics) files from

Stack register always counts down, and is initialized with #$FF in reset

When setting up palette data $00 is background

Sprites - 
	byte 1 = y position
	byte 2 = tile #
	byte 3 = attributes
	byte 4 = x position
